{\large {\bf Abstract}}

In this research project, we are trying to develop a method for Precision weeding in crop fields. Our initial step is to find the best approach to create a heatmap of the crops and weeds on the whole filed. Once we have such a map, we can feed it to a machine that is capable of spraying areas marked as weed in the field. There have been various approaches in detecting weeds in a crop filed. We will try to summarize many of those useful approaches here. \\
